# Serverless OpenClaw Project Context

This skill provides core project context. It is automatically referenced during implementation tasks.

## Project Overview & Key Decisions

See [PRD.md](../../../docs/PRD.md) for details:
- Project definition, goals, tech stack
- 7 key architecture decisions with rationale
- Monorepo structure (packages/cdk, gateway, container, web, shared)
- DynamoDB 5-table schema
- Core data flows

## Critical Constraints (Must Follow During Implementation)

1. **No NAT Gateway** — Use Fargate Public IP + VPC Gateway Endpoints
2. **No secrets on disk** — Secrets Manager → environment variables only. Never write API keys/tokens to `openclaw.json`
3. **Telegram webhook-only** — Long polling not allowed (API mutually exclusive)
4. **Bridge Bearer token required** — Authentication on all endpoints except `/health`
5. **IDOR prevention** — userId determined server-side (JWT/connectionId reverse lookup). Ignore client input
6. **RunTask API** — Use `capacityProviderStrategy` only. Cannot specify `launchType` simultaneously
7. **Cost target** — ~$1/month. No ALB, Interface Endpoint, or NAT Gateway creation allowed
